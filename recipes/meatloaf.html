        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
            The main point of this Italian meatball-inspired meatloaf 
            is to show you what happens when you make meatloaf like your 
            grandparents did. During the Great Depression, this type of 
            dish was a popular strategy for stretching what little meat 
            you had into as filling a meal as possible.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups very dry white bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
                <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>3 cups tomato sauce, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). <br>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet<br>over medium-high heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil<br>and butter until onion is golden brown and soft, 5 to 10 minutes.<br>Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>Remove skillet from heat and cool onion mixture to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir<br>with a fork until combined. Let sit until all of the milk is absorbed<br>into the breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley,<br>Parmesan cheese, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper<br>in a bowl. Grab a handful of breadcrumbs and squeeze very gently<br>to remove excess milk. Repeat with remaining breadcrumbs,<br>transfer breadcrumbs to ground chuck mixture, and discard excess milk.<br>Stir ground chuck mixture until evenly combined.</li>
                <li>Turn chuck mixture out into prepared baking dish,<br>and shape meat into a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf. Pour tomato sauce over the loaf<br>and into the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in<br>the center, about 1 hour 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted<br>into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).<br>Let meatloaf rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
